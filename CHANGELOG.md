# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-30

### Changed
- Rewrote the entire application with [Avalonia 11](https://avaloniaui.net/) and .NET 10 (C#),
  replacing the previous Flutter implementation while preserving every feature.
- State management moved from Provider/ChangeNotifier to CommunityToolkit.Mvvm (MVVM Toolkit).
- Dependency injection moved from GetIt to Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.
- SQLite access moved from sqflite to Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.

### Added
- Full binary compatibility with databases created by the previous Flutter release
  (identical `lists` / `tasks` schema, `user_version = 4`, migration history preserved).
- Continuous integration workflow (build + test on push and pull request).
- Cross-platform release builds for Windows, macOS (x64 / arm64) and Linux via GitHub Actions.

### Fixed
- Reactive property notifications for connection state and task collections, so the
  quick-add box and smart-list counts refresh reliably after database operations.
- Modal dialogs (emoji / color pickers) now use awaited `ShowDialog`, eliminating the
  race where a selection was not applied back to the list editor.
